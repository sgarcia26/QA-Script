# QA-Script

Create a script that a user is able to parse and input data from a QA CSV into a database​

Script will need to use Argparse​.\
Database will be MongoDB (but can be any other DB if you prefer) Mongo is widely used in M&E for it's ease of flexible scheme, completely versitile non-relational DB​.\
Will input your weekly QA reports into Collection 1​.\
Will input a mock "DB dump" which will be everyone's reports in one mega file into Collection 2 (watch out! missing dates!).\
Use DB to quickly create own reports (do this programmatically).


Deliverables
1. Copy/paste code
2. Console output of all runs (each individual -  3 Total runs (Weekly assignment 4-6) and then final collective QA CSV, these runs should populate the database) along with runs to answer database questions below
3. Database Answers (From "Database Calls" and done programmatically i.e python).
  List all work done by Your user - from both collections(No duplicates).​\
  All repeatable bugs- from both collections(No duplicates).​\
  All Blocker bugs- from both collections(No duplicates)​.\
  All reports on build 10/8/2024- from both collections(No duplicates).​\
  Report back the very 1st test case of User A, the middle test case (you determine that of B), and the final test case of your database of User C.\
5. CSV export of user "Kevin Chaja" (use argparse to trigger code) - from collection 2
