# QA-Script

Create a script that a user is able to parse and input data from a QA CSV into a database​

Script will need to use Argparse​. 
Database will be MongoDB (but can be any other DB if you prefer) Mongo is widely used in M&E for it's ease of flexible scheme, completely versitile non-relational DB​. 
Will input your weekly QA reports into Collection 1​. 
Will input a mock "DB dump" which will be everyone's reports in one mega file into Collection 2 (watch out! missing dates!). 
Use DB to quickly create own reports (do this programmatically)
