Test Case: user case: explain the context of each phase under the announcement or in the middle of that phase
Expected Result: I expect to see a small description of what each phase means.
Actual Result: since I suggested that the phase-announcements be extended for a bit longer (1 to 2 seconds), there should be a small description (perhaps instructions, such as "draw a card" or "activate any action cards". This helps me understand why we need two phases instead of one, and what I expect to do in this phase. additionally, this could also be implemented in the tutorial by further elaborating each phase/step of the game.
